Branches are normally very unobtrusive, down sidestreets near docks or market squares. Footfall would seem to be too low to sustain a trading organisation of this size.

As well as being a normal customer, people can also become an associate of the company by doing a favour for them. This gives better prices, an element of trust and branches will also buy some items.

Trusted associates can become friends of Westford, at which point they will be able to access better items in stores and the branches will buy anything from them, no questions asked.

Whilst we are currently friends of Westford, we are starting to suspect that it may be a front for a criminal organistion.
