During breakfast, we met with {{< npc Pennich >}} and agreed to leave for {{< place "Underbrow-on-Grime" >}} this morning.<!--more-->

Just after breakfast, but before we left, we managed to buy three horses from the local stable. I named my white mare Ghost, Tooms named his piebald gelding Jeroboam (Jerry) and Grun named his brown mare Tabeesie.

With very little fanfare with left {{< place Beechburton >}} behind and begun the three day journey to Underbrow.

Today's journey was quiet, and we have settled down just off the road to rest tonight.
