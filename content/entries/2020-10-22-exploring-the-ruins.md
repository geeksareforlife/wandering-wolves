We were making our way back down the stairs and into the central room when I nearly fell into a pit. As we edged around, we find another pit and two jellies across it.<!--more-->

Tooms threw flames again and we engaged.

After we defeated the jellies we investigated the rest of the floor but found nothing, so we headed down the stairs and found a massive, intricately carved door leading to an altar room with hundreds of gold lizard coins.

We gathered the coins and also noticed a map on the wall. We recognised it as a map of Aptis, with the location we are at marked. Four other places are also marked, so we transfer these to our map. Maybe there are more of these {{< place "Ancient Sites" >}}?

A number of short, different coloured, corridors later, we entered a very large room with circular floor surrounded by shallow water.

A wight and two minotaurs attack, giving us all a beating. We do manage to defeat them eventually.

Searching the bodies, we found a longsword, a wand of magic missiles and a ring of water walking, which I took. I also attempted to get a minotaur horn, but broke it and only got shards.

We headed back and told {{< npc Sprune >}} about the dungeons. We then exchange the coins for gold and head back to {{< place "Underbrow-on-Grime" Underbrow >}}.
