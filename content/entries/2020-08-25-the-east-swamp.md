This morning we met {{< npc "Pennich" >}}, a trader for the {{< org "Westford Trading Company" >}}. We have agreed to escort him on his journey to {{< location "Underbrow-on-Grime" >}} in return for an introduction to Westford. We leave in the morning.

The Cabells also visit us at breakfast with a gift of horses and I name my large white mare Ghost.
