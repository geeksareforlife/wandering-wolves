{{< npc Vayne >}} approached us at breakfast and asked us if we were leaving soon and when we told her that we were leaving today for Caltranâ€™s Roost, she asked for some favours.

She would like us to return {{< npc Veltin "Veltrin's" >}} hat to him. Tooms knew it was magical, and we got {{< npc Campbell >}} to identify it for us - a hat of disguise!

Vayne was also worried about {{< npc Marta >}} - she believes that she may amount to nothing if she stays in {{< place "Underbrow-on-Grime" Underbrow >}}. There is a Magic {{< location "Ulsk University of Magic" "University" >}} in {{< place Ulsk >}} for students with innate magical abilities and she would like us to take Marta there. Tooms has reservations about taking a child, as they would be in unfamiliar, potentially dangerous situations, and the opportunity at the end is not guaranteed. Grun and I believe that it is worth the risk, and we agreed to think about it.

Whilst we were at {{< location Campbells >}} I got myself a set of jeweller's tools, and Tooms got some hunting trap disarming tools and an antidote kit.

Before we set off for {{< place "Caltans Roost" >}} we let Alf know we were leaving, and whilst we were there he told us that {{< org "Westford Trading Company" >}} has friends like Veltrin that carry out "jobs"

As we were leaving, our path was blocked at the gate by a contingent of soldiers. The officer asks us if there is anywhere to stay, and we directed them to the {{< location "Cleft Boulder" >}}. They wish that they had more people, and told us that they felt that they were being watched and/or followed.  They wouldn't tell us what they had been up though, except that it is on orders of the {{< npc "King Daltrim" King >}}.
