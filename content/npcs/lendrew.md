You are doing excellent work but I must remind you that this must remain secret. Remember to only recruit novices and acolytes that you can fully trust and who won't be missed.

Your recent activities have bolstered our forces from your region significantly. Please continue to send all troops to mountains with haste.

Together we will achieve our objective. Have faith and you will be rewarded.
