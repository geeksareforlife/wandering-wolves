We arrived back in {{< place "Underbrow-on-Grime" Underbrow >}} and headed to the {{< location "Silver Oak" >}}, where {{< npc Marta >}} was waiting for us.<!--more-->

She told us that the {{< group "Green Cloaks" >}} have mainly been sitting in the Silver Oak, and that no one really knows why the {{<group "Hartess Family" "Hartesseâ€™s" >}} are gone, but the mine and shipping routes being open are helping the town.

We also met a fellow {{< org "Westford Trading Company" Westford >}} Associate, {{< npc Veltin >}}. As favour to him, we marked the location of the temple we had just explored. He told us that he can get into places as needed and find information.

I'm starting to think that Westford is not just a simple trading organisation.

He told us that {{< place "Caltan's Roost" >}} is a funny little place, off the beaten track in the mountains.  The Duke there has a large military force and it a well defended, walled town. The residents keep themselves to themselves and there is a lot of tannery and glue industries. The Duke is part {{< group "Hartess Family" Hartess >}} and part {{< group "Sconce Family" Sconce >}}.

Veltin is going to be in town for a few days, and that he keeps rooms in {{< place Ulsk >}} at {{< location "The Drunken Albatross" >}}, if we need to contact him. 

Veltin is also handy in breaking in places without detection which could be used as a favour in the future.
