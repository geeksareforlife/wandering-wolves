Last night happened extremely quickly. Almost as soon as dusk fell three large otherworldly hounds fell upon the house. Together we managed to fight them off, but as the last one feel we heard a scream from the house - {{< npc "Athon Cabell" "Athon" >}} had been knocked unconscious and {{< npc "Henry Cabell" "Henry" >}} had been taken out through the side door and into the forest. {{< npc "Katrin Cabell" "Katrin" >}} had not seen who did it, but {{< npc "Berry Staypell" "Berry" >}} the housekeeper is also missing. We took off into the forest, tracking footprints.

The tracks lead us a short distance to a low stone building - the Cabell family tomb. Down in the tomb we found Berry, who was scrawling runes on the wall and performing a rite of some sort. Henry was a short distance away from her. We got her attention and she told us that she was {{< npc "Yeth" >}}, and produced the contract that Richard Cabell, Athon's ancestor, had signed 400 years ago. It appeared iron-clad, and is pasted below.

When we stepped forward and told her that we would need to take Henry back to his parents and she suddenly turned in a huge, deep red beast with huge wings, and it was immediately clear that we would not be able to beat her. She also told us that even if we did kill her here she would return to the Nine Hells and then continue to try and abduct Henry at a later date.

Tooms told us to keep her busy and then ran from the tomb while Grun and I engaged the beast. We were quickly outmatched, but continued to battle, keeping her from leaving the tomb or continuing the rite. After a few minutes she suddenly screamed and disappeared, leaving Henry.

We took Henry back to the house and discovered that Tooms had convinced Athon to sign the house and lordship over to him, nullifying the contract. He is now Lord Tufail ibn Usama ibn Masoud Al-Jamra, and the Cabells are living in his manor home, managing its upkeep.

The {{< group "Cabell Family" "Cabells" >}} are extremely grateful and rewarded us all with small pouches of gold, as well as paying for rooms at the inn in town.
