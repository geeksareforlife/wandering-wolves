When we got the landslide we found it had revealed an ominous doorway in the side of a cliff. We also found {{< npc Sprune >}} 20 or so feet away sketching the doorway on an easel in front of his shelter.<!--more-->

We introduced ourselves and he tells of the fine stonework around the door, but that he has also seen animals and orcs and goblins going in and out of the door.

The door led into a room with just stairs going down. It was probably the top of a long-buried structure. Sprune asked if we could clear a path into the structure and offered us 200 gp each, we agreed.

As we entered, Grun cast a spell to hide our tracks and we headed down the right hand stairs into a room with a large carved weather feature and a deep pit filled with a liquid that was certainly not water. Drawn on the floor in front of the pit is a red crescent and a thick, round pole that freely rotates lies across it. 

Grun froze the log in place and I made my way across into a darkened corridor running left to right, although the right hand direction was a dead end. Tooms threw me a rope which I secured and he also came across as Grun became a lizard and scurried across the pit.

We headed left towards a stone door that was carved to look like lizard scales. In the small room beyond had two staircases heading down and two more doors on the left wall, the left-most of which led to a corridor with more cracked stonework that rans for around 20ft and then headed left.

The right hand door revealed a longer corridor heading straight ahead, but two spiders dropped onto us and immediately attacked. We managed to destroy them, but the thunder spell that Grun used attracted two bats and four gnolls which rushed in to attack.

After a drawn out battle, we continued down the corridor and found a band of Orcs playing Kruk. I attempted to join in, but the Orcs took offence and we ended up killing all four of them. As we explored that floor further we found six goblins that are made short work with Grun’s moonbeam.

But at least I now have a copy of {{< object kruk "Kruk!" >}} Grun tells me he wants to learn how to play!

Shortly after this, we meet a ghost that demands we leave. When we don’t it attacked and we took a huge amount of damage, but managed to defeat it, for now.

Shortly afterwards, we found a room with two mummies. Grun had wildshaped into a spider to investigate, so the mummies did not see us. When Tooms hears of the mummies he steamed into the room and attacked with bouts of fire!

We managed to defeat both mummies, but I took even amount of damage. We realised that night was coming and retreated to the higher floor to rest, with Tooms taking first watch.

Our rest was disturbed by two relatively friendly boars, but we managed to get back to sleep.
