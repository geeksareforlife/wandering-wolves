This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using the excellent [Tailwind Starter](https://github.com/dirkolbrich/hugo-theme-tailwindcss-starter) as a base.

Thank you to NASA for the images of our moon which I butchered to make the images of Luna and Celene.

Thank you to [Kit](https://kitdraws.com/) (Tooms) for all of the excellent artwork.
