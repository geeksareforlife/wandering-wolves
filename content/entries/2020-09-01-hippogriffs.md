We continued the journey to {{< place "Underbrow-on-Grime" >}}, which was uneventful up until lunchtime, when we encountered two Hippogriffs.<!--more-->

They attacked us so we dismounted and defended ourselves.

Once the first Hippogriff was killed, the second started to retreat. Unfortunately, I was mid-rage and unabel to control myself. I pursued and killed the fleeing creature.

I can tell that Grun is upset with me about this, I will need to be more careful in the future.
