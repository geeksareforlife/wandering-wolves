After breakfast I visited {{< location "Rotchett and Finn" >}} and asked them to convert my Temple robes into a riding cloak. They agree, and it will be ready in a couple of days.<!--more-->

We then head to {{< location "Westford Underbrow" "Westford" >}} where Alf tells us he has some information for us, which will be a favour and we will “owe him”. We agreed, and he told us of the same landslide that the {{< group "Green Cloaks" >}} told us about. But he knew where the landslide has happened - South East of the town, about 2 days by horse.

Back at the {{< location "Silver Oak" >}} we left some money and a message with Vayne for Marta and head off to the location of the landslide.

As we settled down for the night, Grun summoned a Sabre Tooth tiger to hunt for dinner. He caught two deer and we ate a lovely venison stew.

During the night, Tooms and I both heard a low pounding sound, long away in the direction we are heading.
