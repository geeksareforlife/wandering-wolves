This morning we met {{< npc "Pennich" >}}, a trader for the {{< org "Westford Trading Company" >}}. We have agreed to escort him on his journey to {{< location "Underbrow-on-Grime" >}} in return for an introduction to Westford. We leave in the morning.<!--more-->

{{< npc "Katrin Cabell" "Lady Cabell" >}} also visits us at breakfast. She has received a letter from an old friend, the {{< npc "Abess Habed" "The Abess" >}} of {{< location "Temple of Lathanda" >}}, which has concerned her and would like us to visit her and help if we can. As the temple is also in Underbrow, we let her know that we will try.

Immediately after breakfast we visited the local smith and I asked him to silver Hrun for me, which meant leaving my axe at the forge for the day. Tooms got an arrow silvered at the same time.

Afterwards we visited {{< npc "Ethel" >}}, the local healer, to see if we could buy some healing potions. She explained that she needs Umber Blossoms, which are normally collected for her by {{< npc "Berry Staypell" "Berry" >}} (the dead housekeeper). She offered us a discounted rate if we can collect it for her from the {{< location "East Swamp" >}}.

The East swamp was just outside the village, but when we arrived there was a strange mist over the swamp. As we travelled in to find the flowers, we encountered a Wisp, which we managed to defeat and then a group of zombies. I was exceedingly upset to have left Hrun behind, but we managed to defeat all three zombies as well as their oversized companion.

Eventually we found the flower and returned to Ethel, buying a couple of potions.

Later in the evening, we managed to buy three horses from the local stable. I named my white mare Ghost, Tooms named his piebald gelding Jeroboam (Jerry) and Grun named his brown mare Tabeesie.

After dinner at {{< location "Doyle's Inn" >}}, we retired for the evening so we would be ready for our journey to Underbrow tomorrow.
