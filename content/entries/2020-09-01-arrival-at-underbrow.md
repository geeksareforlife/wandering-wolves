As we approached {{< place "Underbrow-on-Grime" >}}, we were stopped at a bridge by group of bandits, led {{< npc Danyl >}}.<!--more-->

Danyl informed us that this was "his bridge" and we had to pay a toll to cross. We disagreed.

The bandits attacked, and immediately Grun brought down a shaft of radiant light on the group of three bandits, and Tooms and I concentrated on Danyl. We managed to defeat the three underlings and capture Danyl.

After the battle, we discovered a couple of barrels of ale with "Silver Oak" stamped on the side, as well as a love letter to Danyl from {{< npc Susanne >}}.

We headed to Underbrow and met a guard at the gate - {{< npc Stine >}}. We handed Danyl over to him, and discovered that we could probably find Susanne in the {{< location "Cleft Boulder" >}}, where she is staying.

We also discovered that the {{< location "Silver Oak" >}} is another inn which is in the north of the town, is the more upmarket area.

We headed directly to the Silver Oak, which has a female goliath guarding it. After we showed her the barrels she let us in and we met {{< npc Vayne >}} who is grateful to us for returning them. She offers us rooms for the night in return which we accept.

We also visited the Cleft Boulder and let Susanne know about Danyl. She was not particularly surprised, but still not happy with us, and leaves shortly after us.

Whilst at the Cleft Boulder, we also found out that someone called Andrew had gone missing from the Temple poor house.

We will head to the Temple tomorrow to see what is happening.
