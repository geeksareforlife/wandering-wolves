The Silver Oak is an inn in the northern, more affluent area of Underbrow.<!--more-->

Run by {{< npc "Vayne" >}}, this is where we normally stay when in the town. We currently have an arrangement with Vayne that allows us to direct any messages there for us to pick up later.

{{< npc "Ortis" >}} provides protection to the inn.
